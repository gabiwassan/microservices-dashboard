# 🎮 Microservices Dashboard - Because Who Needs 42 Terminal Tabs? 

> "In the beginning there was darkness... and way too many terminal windows" - A Developer's Genesis

## 🤔 Why This Exists
Ever found yourself with so many terminal tabs open that your computer started sweating? Yeah, me too. 
This dashboard was born from the chaos of managing multiple microservices and the constant "wait, which port was that service running on again?" moments.

## 🚀 Quick Start (For The Impatient Devs)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 20.0.0 (yes, we're living in the future 🚀)
- npm or yarn (we don't judge 😉)
- A will to reduce your terminal tab count

### The "Just Make It Work" Steps
1. Drop your coffee ☕, open your terminal, and type:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Cross your fingers and run:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and witness the magic ✨

## 🗂 What's in the Box?
- `/server` - The backend magic happens here 🎩
- `/client` - Pretty stuff lives here 🎨

## 🤓 Technical Stuff
This is a production build running on SSR (Server Side Rendering, not the Soviet Socialist Republic).

## ⚠️ Warning
- This is a production build. Please don't poke around the compiled code unless you enjoy reading minified JavaScript for fun.
- If you find yourself talking to the dashboard, maybe it's time for another coffee break.

## 🐛 Found a Bug?
First, try turning it off and on again. If that doesn't work, it's probably a feature.

## 🎭 Final Words
The light mode was made for the special of Jose. 🤓
